### Findings

I think that I could use a little more practice with decorators, as I was having trouble implementing the emphasize one until I realized it required a return to work, I originally just had it print, which worked fine with pause, which didn't need to edit the value at all. In hindsight, it makes sense. I'm pretty pumped about all of the different ways we can change up how our custom classes and functions work.
